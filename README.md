# Ethan Nguyen

I wanted to be an inventor to create and be part of something big. Those ideas influenced me to get a bachelor's degree in Computer engineering from California state university. My experience spans from playing with legos as a kid to working with brilliant minds on nuclear power systems. I've programming microcontrollers for professors, worked with VBScript in assisting tech writers, and creating Python scripts for SWE managers. 

###  Featured Projects
- [**Embedded Weather Quest**](https://github.com/EthanNguyen112/Uni-Projects/tree/main/Embedded_Weather_Quest): IoT system displaying real-time weather data on an LCD using Wi-Fi and APIs.  
- [**Bluetooth Robot Car**](https://github.com/EthanNguyen112/Uni-Projects/tree/main/Bluetooth_Controlled_Robot_Car): TM4C123-based RC car controlled via UART and Bluetooth.  
- [**Serial Terminal Calculator**](https://github.com/EthanNguyen112/Uni-Projects/tree/main/Serial_Terminal_Calculator): A serial communication calculator program built on the 8051 microcontroller

*What I’ve Worked On*

Embedded Weather Quest – IoT weather application using API integration and LCD display.

Bluetooth Controlled Robot Car – Real-time wireless control using UART and HC-05 module.

Traffic Light Controller – Finite state machine design for multi-direction control logic.

Serial Terminal Calculator – 8051-based serial interface calculator for number system operations.

Automation Tools (L3Harris Internship) – Developed Python/VBScript tools to automate documentation and track 50+ Jira tickets, improving team visibility and productivity.

IOS AppCounter - Makes the user more aware of selected apps to help lower screen time.
