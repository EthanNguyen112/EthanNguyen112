# Ethan Nguyen
**
I’m a Software & Embedded Systems Engineer who loves building tools that automate, connect, and simplify. My experience spans from Python automation and data pipelines to embedded development with TM4C123 microcontrollers, integrating hardware and software for real-world systems.

I’m especially interested in IoT systems, automation scripting, and low-level programming, with a focus on writing clean, efficient, and reliable code.

###  Featured Projects
- [**Embedded Weather Quest**](#): IoT system displaying real-time weather data on an LCD using Wi-Fi and APIs.  
- [**Bluetooth Robot Car**](#): TM4C123-based RC car controlled via UART and Bluetooth.  
- [**Automation Suite (L3Harris)**](#): Python tools to track 50+ Jira tickets, reducing manual reporting time by 40%.

What I’ve Worked On

Embedded Weather Quest – IoT weather application using API integration and LCD display.

Bluetooth Controlled Robot Car – Real-time wireless control using UART and HC-05 module.

Traffic Light Controller – Finite state machine design for multi-direction control logic.

Serial Terminal Calculator – 8051-based serial interface calculator for number system operations.

Automation Tools (L3Harris Internship) – Developed Python/VBScript tools to automate documentation and track 50+ Jira tickets, improving team visibility and productivity.

###  About Me
I enjoy building things that live at the intersection of **hardware and software** — from IoT systems that pull real-time weather data to automation scripts that simplify engineering workflows.  
Outside of coding, I like tinkering with Arduinos, fixing up tech gear, and learning how things work under the hood.

### Currently Exploring
- AWS Cloud Practitioner Certification  
- Full-stack web development (React + Flask)  
- Embedded networking and secure IoT systems
